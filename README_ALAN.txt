Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Visual Studio Code installed.
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Selenium WebDriver and ChromeDriver set up.
The Java extension for Visual Studio Code installed.
Setting Up the Project
Open Visual Studio Code.
Create a new Java project or open an existing one in which your test classes are located.
Make sure that you have a test class (e.g., LoginTest) with test methods, as shown in your provided code.
Configuring Test Dependencies
Before running tests, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies and extensions installed. You can install them in your project's pom.xml if you are using Maven. For example, you need the following dependencies for JUnit and Selenium:

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>3.141.59</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.8.1</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

Running Tests in Visual Studio Code
Now that your test class and project are set up, follow these steps to run the tests in Visual Studio Code using the Testing tab:

Open the LoginTest.java file in Visual Studio Code.

Ensure that the Java extension is enabled in Visual Studio Code.

Open the "Testing" tab by clicking on the testing icon in the left sidebar.

Click the "Run All Tests" button or right-click the test class name (LoginTest) and select "Run All Tests."

Visual Studio Code will start the test runner and execute your test methods.

You can view the test results and any failures in the Testing tab.

To view the detailed test results, click on a specific test method name in the Testing tab. This will open the test output in the integrated terminal.

Customizing Test Run Configurations
If you need to customize your test run configurations, you can create a junit-platform.properties file in your project's root directory. For example, to specify a custom test class name or package for execution, add the following to the properties file:


junit.jupiter.test.classes.includeClassNamePatterns=your.package.name.LoginTest
